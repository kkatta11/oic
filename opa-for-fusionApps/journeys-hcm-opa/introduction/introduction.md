# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop illustrates how to configure the native Process Automation task type in the Journeys feature in Oracle HCM Cloud. The sample process used as an example in this workshop relates to the selection of a uniform by an employee and the subsequent approval step by procurement manager prior to an email confirmation sent to the uniform distributor.

Estimated Time: 90 minutes

### Background

This workshop outlines the steps to integrate HCM Cloud Journeys with the Oracle Process Automation (OPA) product. This offering is known as HCM Journey Booster.

Journeys Booster helps integrate HR processes and other business functions such as finance, operations, and facilities management with third-party systems and external applications. This enables end-to-end process completion in a single experience, supported by the process automation capabilities of OPA, with minimal coding needed. Journeys Booster automates requests and services across HR, IT, and other work systems and can also be expanded via HR Helpdesk when additional support is needed within workflows.

You will need a hybridized instance of OPA. Use of OPA with HCM Journeys Booster & HR Help Desk requires a subscription to the Oracle Process Automation for Fusion Applications which is provisioned via a separate SKU.

### What Will You Learn?

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
- Create a process application and its components
    - Create roles
    - Create a process
    - Create Human Tasks and Forms
    - Create Connector
- Activate a process application
- Create a new HCM Journey
- Assign HCM Journey to employee

### What Do You Need?

* You will require access to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Process Automation instance in conjunction with a subscription to a Fusion-based Oracle Cloud Applications service, such as Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM) Cloud. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Process Automation will be provisioned automatically for you.

### What is Process Automation?

Process Automation is used to rapidly *design*, *automate*, and *manage* business processes in the cloud

Key capabilities include:
  - Structured and dynamic process modeling
  - Decision Modelling
  - Connectivity to outside apps and integrations
  - Web forms
  - User task management and tracking

### Get Started

Process Automation is available in two models - as an individual or standalone Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service, and as a service paired with a Fusion-based Cloud application (such as HCM Cloud or CX Cloud). For information about these service types, see [Service Types](https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/cloud/paas/process-automation&id=PRADM-GUID-29821BED-7F66-495A-879C-04688C54454E).

The service has two environments:

  - **Design time** (Designer): for developing, testing, and activating process applications
  - **Runtime** (Workspace): for running, monitoring, and managing activated applications
