    ![Add Robot](images/projects_add-robot.png "")

    > **Note**: The **Add** button appears if you have no robots. The **+** button appears if you have at least one robot.

4. In the **Create robot** panel, fill in the following fields:
    | **Field** | **Required** | **Value** |
    | --- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Name          | Yes | Enter a name for the robot connection type For example: `LiveLabs Robot`       |
    | Identifier    | Yes | This entry is autogenerated based on the Name value.  |
    | Version       | Yes | Keep as default: `1.00.00` |
    | Description   | No  | Provide additional information about the robot.|
    | Keywords      | No  | Enter text that people might use to search for the robot. |

    ![Create robot panel](images/create-robot-add.png " ")

5. Click **Create**.

The Robot Designer will appear, with a default robot which includes an **Open Application** action.
![Robot Designer Canvas](images/robot-designer_after-create.png " ")

## Task 2: Specify Input and Output Triggers

The trigger defines the interface for the robot, including the input (incoming request) and the output (outgoing response). For this lab, we will provide a purchase order number as input, and capture the supplier name as output.

1. Select ![Create robot panel](images/click-to-edit-trigger-button-small.png) **(Click to edit trigger)**

    The trigger panel will appear on the screen.

2. On the **Input** tab, click **+ (Add)** and enter the following Input property values:

    * Name: `PONumber`
    * Type: `String` (default)

3. Select the **Output** tab, click **+ (Add)** and enter the following Output property values:

    * Name: `SupplierName`
    * Type: `String` (default)

4. Click **OK**.

## Task 3: Define Open Application Action

This action tells the robot to open a web browser and navigate to the Oracle ERP Cloud sign-in page. We will use the robot connection created in the previous lab to pull the service URL and credentials.

1. Double-click on the **Open Application** action.

    ![Select robot connections button](images/robot-designer_open-browser_edit.png " ")

2. In the **Open Browser** panel, keep the default values for **Name** and **Description**.

3. We will assign the target URL dynamically using a Robot Connection. On the **Input** tab, select within the **URL** field and click on the ![Select robot connections button](images/robot-connections-button.png) (**Robot connections**) icon.

    The **Robot connections** side panel will appear, with the previously created robot connection.

4. Returning to the **Robot connections** side panel, expand the newly created Robot Connection. Next, drag the **URL** parameter to the matching field under the **Input** tab.

    ![Drag the URL parameter to the Input tab](images/robot-designer_open-browser_assign-url.png " ")

5. Under **Browser**, select the browser which will be used by the robot. Keep all other values as default.

6. Click **OK** when done, then **Save**.

7. In another browser window, open the sign-in page for the Oracle Fusion environment that the robot will work in. For example, to access Oracle Cloud ERP, your login URL pattern will be:
`https://<Fusion-domain>.fa.<data-center>.oraclecloud.com/fscmUI/faces/FuseWelcome`

8. On the canvas, select the action to record after, you can select the **Open Application** action
9. On the toolbar, select Record after the selected action Record after the selected action.
The Smart record panel appears. If you haven't installed the recorder, Browser extension not detected appears and follow Task 4, otherwise skip Task 4.
    ![Record action](images/recordaction.png " ")

## Task 4: Install the recorder (Optional if you have not installed the recorder)

The recorder is an extension that you use to build robots. Everyone who builds robots must install the recorder.

1. Select Install browser extension.
    ![browserextensionnotdetected action](images/browserextensionnotdetected.png " ")
2. Select Add to Chrome, In the pop-up, select Add extension.
The Oracle Robot Flow Designer extension is installed to your browser. A pop-up appears when the installation is finished.
3. Refresh the browser window where Oracle Integration is open. If you work in an Incognito window, allow the extension in Incognito windows.
    Perform these steps in an Incognito browser or a regular Chrome browser.
        a. In Google Chrome, open the Extensions Extensions menu, and select Manage Extensions.
        b. In the box for the Oracle Robot Designer Extension, select Details.
        c. Enable the Allow in Incognito setting.
4. Close the **Extensions** tab and return to the Robot. Click **Save**, reopen the project.

## Task 5: Add ERP Login Actions using the Record option

While building the rest of the robot, you'll record the actions that the robot completes using the recorder, all while harnessing the power of control and power of the low-code capabilities. We will navigate the Fusion pages using UI actions (e.g. mouse clicks, keyboard entries), which will automatically generate the relevant robot actions on the flow.

1. Click the **Record after the selected option** button to start recording after the selected **Open Application** action.  ![Record button enabled](images/recordaction.png " ")

2. On the **Smart Record** panel, click **Select browser tab to target** drop-down.

3. Select the window title which coincides with the Oracle ERP Cloud tab.
