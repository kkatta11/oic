# Create Connections

## Introduction

This lab will walk you through the steps to create connections for all the services which will be used in the Integration Flow.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse connection
- Create an Oracle FTP Connection

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Completed all the previous labs.

## Task 1: Create an Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Connection

Create a connection with the Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse Adapter.

1. In the left Navigation pane, click ***Projects***, click on the project which you have created.
    You can please skip this step if you are already in the project.
2. In the **Connections** section, click ***Add*** to create a new connection.

3. In the *Create Connection* dialog, select the **Oracle ADW** adapter to use for this connection. To find the adapter, enter `Oracle` in the search field. Click on the highlighted adapter.

4. In the *Create Connection* dialog, enter the following information and click **Create**

    | **Field**        | **Value**          |
    | --- | ----------- |
    | Name         | `LLDemo_ADW`       |
    | Description  | `ADW Connection for LiveLabs` |

    Keep all other values as default.

    > **Note:** If you are a Bootcamp user then execute step 5 only and skip other steps.
    If you are a non Bootcamp user then skip step 5 and continue with other steps..

5. Search for **LLDemo**, Please note that the connection with the name **LLDemo\_ADW** is already created by the instructors, configured and shared with other projects. Do not get confused with the same name, both the connections are in the different projects. Click on **LLDemo\_ADW** and click on **Save**. Exit the connection canvas by clicking the back button on the top left side of the screen.

You can share adapter connection resources across projects. For example, you may have two projects that need to integrate with a common system, such as Oracle ERP Cloud. The connection you created is referencing the shared connection in the instance.

6. In the *Oracle ADW Connection* dialog, enter the following information:

    | **Field**  | **Value** |
    |---------------|----------------|
    |Service Name | `<your-adb-tns-name>` (Use the TNS Name obtained in **Lab Setup** &gt; **Task 3** &gt; **Step 6**) |
    |Security Policy | **JDBC With OCI Signature**|
    |Wallet | **Upload wallet file (Zip)** |
    |Wallet Password | `<wallet-password>`|
    |Database Service Username | `<db-service-username>` (Default: `ADMIN`)|
    |Database Service Password | `<db-service-password>` |
    |Object Storage Region | `<object-storage-region-identifier>` |
    |Object Storage Tenancy OCID | `<object-storage-tenancy-ocid>` |
    |Object Storage Compartment OCID | `<object-storage-compartment-ocid>` |
    |Object Storage User OCID | `<object-storage-user-ocid>` |
    |Private Key | `<*.pem file>` |
    |Finger Print | `<api-key-finger-print>` |

    > **Note:**  The information obtained from the Lab *Setup* will be used to fill in the details to create Connection.

7. Click on **Test**, followed by **Save**. Exit the connection canvas by clicking the back button on the top left side of the screen.

## Task 2: Create Connection with File Server

To access the File Server from an Integration, you will need to create an FTP Connection.  

1. In the left Navigation pane, click ***Projects***, click on the project which you have created.
    You can please skip this step if you are already in the project.
2. In the **Connections** section, click ***Add*** to create a new connection.

3. Select the **FTP** Adapter.
4. From the *Create Connection* dialog, *Name* your connection as **File Server** and select *Role* as **Invoke** and leave the rest of the configurations as default. Click **Create**
    > **Note:** If you are a Bootcamp user then execute step 5 only and skip other steps.
    If you are a non Bootcamp user then skip step 5 and continue with other steps..

5. Search for **File**, Please note that the connection with the name **File Server** is already created by the instructors, configured and shared with other projects.
Do not get confused with the same name, both the connections are in the different projects so, we are good with it. And click on **File Server** and click on **Save**. Exit the connection canvas by clicking the back button on the top left side of the screen.

6. Enter the following configurations in the *FTP Connection* with the information you previously gathered from the File Server Settings page.  

    | Field                   | Value                                                 |
    |-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
    | FTP Server Host Address | From File Server Settings - IP and Port Information   |
    | FPT Server Port         | From File Server Settings - IP and Port Information   |
    | SFTP Connection         | Yes                                                   |
    | Security                | FTP Server Access Policy                              |
    | Username                | Your Oracle Integration username                      |
    | Password                | Your Oracle Integration password                      |

7. Confirm your Connection by clicking **Test**, then **Diagnose & Test**. You should see the *Connection File Server was tested successfully* confirmation message. Click **Save** and exit the Connection editor.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
