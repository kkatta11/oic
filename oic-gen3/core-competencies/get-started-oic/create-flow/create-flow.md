# Create an Integration flow

## Introduction

This lab will walk you through the steps to create an end-to-end integration of reading a file from the File Server and inserting the data set in an Oracle Autonomous (ADW) Table.

![Integration Architecture](images/get-started-integration-scenario.png)

In this use case, a scheduled orchestration pattern in OIC is used to automate the transfer and processing of sales order data. The process begins by reading a sales orders file from an SFTP server at scheduled intervals. Once the file is retrieved, it goes through necessary transformations or validations in OIC to prepare the data for database insertion.

The Oracle Autonomous Database adapter in OIC simplifies bulk data loading by leveraging an Object Storage staging area. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **File Staging**: Instead of directly inserting each record individually, the adapter stages the processed file in an Oracle Object Storage location. This staging reduces the overhead on the database by pre-loading the data into a format suited for bulk operations.

2. **Bulk Data Import**: Using the pre-configured object storage location, the adapter then performs a bulk import into the Autonomous Database. This approach optimizes performance, making it highly efficient for large volumes of sales order data.

3. **Database Insertion**: Once staged, the sales order data is inserted into the appropriate tables in the Oracle Autonomous Database, making the data readily available for further analysis, reporting, or business applications.

This integration approach ensures efficient and scalable handling of large data volumes, minimizes manual intervention, and enables reliable data transfer between systems. It is especially useful for organizations that need to frequently process and analyze sales order data from various sources.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

    | **Element**        | **Value**          |
    | --- | ----------- |
    | What do you want to call your endpoint? | **insertSalesOrders**       |
    | What operation do you want to perform? | **Perform Bulk Data Import Operation** |
    {: title="ADW Basic Info"}

    - Click **Continue**

3. On the *Bulk load from Object Storage to ATP table* page, select the following values:

    | **Element**        | **Value**          |
    | --- | ----------- |
    | Select Bucket | **bulk-orders** (Select the Object Storage bucket that was created in previous lab)  |
    | Delete file from object store after operation completion | **Deselect** |
    | Select Schema | **ADMIN** |
    | Select Table | Select **V\_SALES\_ORDERS**|
    | Table columns | Click on ![Move all](images/move-all.png) to move all the fields to the *Selected* box|
    {: title="Object Storage Info"}

    ![Choose Table in AWD Wizard](images/adw-wizard-choose-table.png)

    > **Note:** The order of the columns should match the input sales_order.csv data

4. Click on **Edit**, in the *Bulk load from Object storage to ATP table* page in the section *Review and specify the copy_data format options*.

    ![Edit Copy Format options](images/edit-copy-data-format-options-1.png)
