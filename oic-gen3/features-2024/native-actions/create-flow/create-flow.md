# Create an Integration Flow to Read Excel file and convert to CSV

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to create an Integration flow as per the below Integration Architecture.

This use case describes how to use Native Actions in Oracle Integration to connect with file server, object storage and serverless functions.

1.  Vendors drop Excel files into the system.
2.  Oracle Integration orchestrates the logic as below:
    - A scheduler triggers the Integration flow.
    - File Server Native Action gets the file from the source.
    - OCI Object Storage Native Action uploads the Excel file to Object Storage.
    - OCI Function is converts the Excel format to CSV format and uploads the file to Object Storage bucket
    - The transformed CSV is retrieved using Object Storage Native Action operations
    - The data is staged in a Virtual File System (VFS).
    - Records are parsed and inserted into the DB system (Optional)
3.  OCI Serverless Functions are used to process the files:
    - A function is triggered to perform operations on the files.
    - The function interacts with Object Storage, reading from and writing to a bucket.

4.  The OIC File Server stores the Excel files for reference.
5.  The parsed and processed data is ultimately stored in the ATP DB (Autonomous Transaction Processing Database).
6.  User Groups have access to the processed files.


The following diagram shows the interaction between the systems involved in this use case.

The Final Integration Flow should look like below.

Estimated Time: 60 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Use Object Storage Native Action
* Use File Server Native Action
* Use Functions Native Action

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

* All previous labs completed.

## Task 1: Pre-Requisites setup for Native Actions

You will create a dynamic group and add policies to use functions and manage objects.

1.  Sign in to the OCI Console as a tenancy administrator.

2.  Obtain the client ID of the OAuth application for the Oracle Integration instance. In the upper right corner, select Profile, then click the identity domain.
![Select Profile](images/select-profile.png)

3.  In the left navigation pane, click *Oracle Cloud Services*.
![Select Oracle Cloud Services](images/select-oracle-cloud-services.png)

4.  Select the OIC service instance, and scroll down to **General Information** and copy the client ID value to use it in the dynamic group creation.

5.  In the OCI Console, Open the navigation menu and click *Identity & Security*, Select the domain (example: Default domain).
![Select Domain](images/default-domain.png)

6. In the left navigation pane, click *Dynamic groups*

7.  Click *Create Dynamic Group*.

8.  Provide a name (example: ll-dynamic-group) and description. In the **Matching Rules** section, enter the below rules. The resource ID you specify mush match the client ID of the OAuth application of your Oracle Integration instance. Provide the functions compartment ocid in the below rule

    ```
    <copy>
    resource.id = 'oic-instance-client-ID'
    ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = '<functions-compartment-ocid>'}
    </copy>
    ```
TIP: Get the ocid of the functions compartment by navigating to Identity &gt; Compartments &gt; ll-native-actions. The first rule is required to group the OIC instance which matches the client id. The second rule groups the functions of a given compartment ocid.

![Dynamic Group Rules](images/dynamic-group-rules.png)

9.   Open the navigation menu and click *Identity & Security*. Under Identity, click *Policies*.

10.  Select the Policy **ll-native-actions-policy** , and Click on **Edit policy statements**. In the Policy builder add the following statements. Modify the dynamic group name, group name and compartment name as per your configuration.

    ```
    <copy>
    Allow dynamic-group ll-dynamic-group to use functions-family in compartment <compartment-name>
    Allow dynamic-group ll-dynamic-group to manage object-family in compartment <compartment-name>
    Allow dynamic-group ll-dynamic-group to inspect compartments in compartment <compartment-name>
    Allow group ll-group to manage objects in compartment <compartment-name>
    </copy>
    ```

## Task 7: Congratulations 🎉

🎉 Congratulations on completing the Workshop! 🎉

You've successfully navigated through the creation and testing of a powerful integration flow using Oracle Integration (OIC) and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services. By automating the transfer, conversion, and processing of Excel files, you’ve harnessed the full potential of OIC's native actions and OCI’s serverless functions to build a seamless, efficient, and scalable data integration solution.

Key Takeaways:

- You’ve learned how to list and transfer files from an FTP server using OIC’s native actions.
- You’ve successfully invoked an OCI function to convert Excel files to CSV, showcasing the power of serverless computing.
- You’ve mastered the art of reading, staging, and processing data files within OIC, paving the way for real-time analytics and business insights.
