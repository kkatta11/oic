# Enable Oracle Process Automation(OPA)

## About this Workshop

To use Process Automation with Oracle Integration, an administrator needs to enable it from an Oracle Integration service instance in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console. When enabled, a Process Automation instance gets automatically provisioned with the Oracle Integration instance. In such a case, the two services become associated with each other and gets listed in each others Associated services page in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:
* Enable Process Automation
* Access OPA service console

### Prerequisites (Optional)

This lab assumes you have:

* All previous labs successfully completed

## Task 1: Enable OPA

To enable a Process Automation instance with an Oracle Integration instance:

1.  On the Oracle Cloud console Get Started page, Click *Developer Services*. Under **Application Integration**, click *Integration*

2.  From the **Compartment** drop-down list, select the compartment in which you want to provision and enable a Process Automation instance with an Oracle Integration instance.

3.  Choose an existing Oracle Integration instance provisioned in the previous lab

4.  Click the *Enable* link for **Process Automation** on the Integration instance information tab

5.  When prompted, click *Enable* to confirm that you want to enable Process Automation. This may take 5-10 minutes to enable the OPA functionality. Once enablement is completed the status should show as **Available**.

6.  Now that a Process Automation instance is enabled and provisioned with an Oracle Integration instance.
    From the navigation menu in the Oracle Integration home page, click the punch out URL for Process Automation. The Process Automation Designer opens in another browser tab and you can start designing your process applications.
