# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop shows you how to design and develop a Bulk Extract Usecase in Oracle Integration 3 integrating with the ERP cloud. Out of the box, ERP Cloud adapter helps an Integration developer to quickly consume Business Events and Business Services in a secured way using various authentication schemes.

Estimated Time: 120 minutes

### Usecase

This use case explores the use of Oracle Integration to extract large data sets from Oracle in an asynchronous fashion leveraging a callback mechanism.

This use case includes the following steps:

* Initiate Payables Transactions Process
* Listen to the callback message delivered from ERP cloud
* Finally, download the extract from UCM and deliver the data set to an SFTP location

 The following diagram shows the interaction between the systems involved in this use case.
