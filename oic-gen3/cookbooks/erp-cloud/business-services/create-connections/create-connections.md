# Create and Configure Connections

## Introduction

This lab will walk you through the steps to create connections for all the services which will be used in the Integration Flow.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create REST connection using REST adapter
- Create ERP Cloud connection using ERP Cloud adapter

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:

- Completed all the previous labs

## Task 1: Create REST Connection using REST adapter

> **Note: Ignore this section if you have a REST Interface connection created already in your Project as part of one of the previous labs.**

Create a connection with the REST Adapter.

1. In the left Navigation pane, click ***Projects***, click on the project which you have created.
    You may skip this step if you are already in the project.
2. In the **Connections** section, click ***Add*** to create a new connection.
3. In the *Create Connection* dialog, select the **REST** adapter. To find the adapter, enter *REST* in the search field. Click on the highlighted adapter.
4. In the *Create Connection* dialog, enter the following information and click on ***Create***:

    | **Field**        | **Value**          |
    | --- | ----------- |
    | Name         | REST Interface     |
    | Role         | Trigger       |
    | Description  | REST Interface Connection for OIC LiveLabs |

    Keep all other values as default.

> **Note: If you are a Bootcamp user then execute step 5 ONLY and skip the other steps.
If you are a non Bootcamp user then skip step 5 and continue from step 6..**

5. In the *Use a shared Connection* section search for **REST Interface** and select the connection which is already created/shared in the Training instance. Exit the connection canvas by clicking the back button on the top left side of the screen.

Please note that the connection with the name **REST Interface** is already created in your training instance, which is configured and shared with other projects. Although both the connections names are similar, they exist in the different projects. You can share adapter connection resources across projects. For example, you may have two projects that need to integrate with a common system, such as Oracle ERP Cloud. The connection you created is referencing the shared connection in the instance.

6. In the *Configuration* page, enter the following information:

    | **Field**  | **Values** |
    |---|---|
    |Security Policy | OAuth 2.0 Or Basic Authentication |

7. Click on ***Test***  and wait until you receive a confirmation box that the test was successful.
8. Click ***Save*** and wait for the confirmation box. Exit the connection canvas by clicking the back button on the top left side of the screen.

## Task 2: Create ERP Cloud Connection using ERP Cloud adapter

> **Note: Ignore this section if you have a ERP Cloud connection created already in your Project as part of one of the previous labs.**

Create a connection with the Oracle ERP Cloud Adapter.

1. In the left Navigation pane, click ***Projects***, click on the project which you have created.
    You can please skip this step if you are already in the project.
2. In the **Connections** section, click ***Add*** to create a new connection.

3. In the *Create Connection* dialog, select the ***Oracle ERP Cloud*** adapter to use for this connection. To find the adapter, enter `erp` in the search field. Click on the highlighted adapter.
4. In the *Create Connection* dialog, enter the following information and click on ***Create***:

    | **Field**        | **Value**          |
    | --- | ----------- |
    | Name         | `ERP Cloud`       |
    | Description  | `ERP Cloud Connection for OIC LiveLabs` |

    Keep all other values as default.

    > **Note:** If you are a Bootcamp user then execute step 5 only and skip other steps.
    If you are a non Bootcamp user then skip step 5 and continue with other steps..

5. Search for **ERP Cloud**, Please note that the connection with the name **ERP Cloud** is already created by the instructors, configured and shared with other projects.
Do not get confused with the same name, both the connections are in the different projects so, we are good with it. And click on **ERP Cloud** and click on **Save**. Exit the connection canvas by clicking the back button on the top left side of the screen.

6. In the *Oracle ERP Cloud Connection* dialog, enter the following information:

    | **Field**  | **Values** |
    |---|---|
    |ERP Cloud Host | `your-erp-host-name` |
    |Security Policy | **Username Password Token**|
    |Username | `<erp-username>`|
    |Password | `<erp-password>`|

7. Click on ***Test*** and wait until you receive a
confirmation box that the test was successful.

    > **Note:** The first time you run the test, it could take up to 2 minutes for completion.

8. Click ***Save*** and wait for the confirmation box. Exit the connection canvas by clicking the back button on the top left side of the screen.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
